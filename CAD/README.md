The folder containing everything related with CAD. 

If you are only interested in `.step` there are in export folder.

If you are not familiar with CAD I will strongly advise you to look out for [Alibre](https://www.alibre.com/fr/). From my research there are the only that propose afordable CAD software with forever licence that can be bought by hobbyist. 

Personnaly I came from CATIA (during studying) and even after making a CAR in CATIA (Formula Student), I don't see limitation in Alibre, even if it is a bit slower.
