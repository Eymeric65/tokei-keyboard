Here you can find both of the Kicad project for the right and left halves of the keyboard.
There is also the result of the paneliser in order to merge both halves (cheaper).

I would advise to check the board with your supplier.

If you trust me entirely you can directly use the archive [JLCPC accepted gerber](/OUTPUT/final-JLCPCB.zip) (for reference $32.37 for 5 boards)
